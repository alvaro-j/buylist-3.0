- Use the <strong>React Context API</strong>:
```js
return <DataContext.Provider value={[items, setItems]}>{children}</DataContext.Provider>;
```
### Useful resources

- [Context API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35lXWvCuM8o) - This helped me understand how to use the Context API from React. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to understand this.
